# HyprRun
Codebase for HyprRun app. Built for 67-443 at CMU

# Project Description

You Set The Vibe 💥

We Curate Tracks For Your Run 🎧

You Crush Your Workout 💪



HyprRun makes running more enjoyable by playing music that changes with YOUR vibe! Like everything in life, we recognize that the pace or goals of your run are not constant. You may want to go faster during certain phases of your run, and slower during others. HyprRun attempts to recommend the track given your current 'vibe'. This means you no longer have to listen to calming classing music while you are attempting to hit a new 5K PR.

# Notes for Instructors

- Unit Testing
  - Due to the robust nature of the Spotify API, we decided to place our efforts elsewhere. Despite its steep learning curve, the Spotify API is really well tested and maintained. So, rather than dedicating valuable resources towards testing an established API, we worked on improving our machine learning classifier. 
  - We felt this was a valuable tradeoff because our users emphasized the need for their music to match the "vibe" of their run. We did not simply want to merge a running app with a music app. We wanted to merge the two and create something special, and that required us to move quicky and focus on the more novel aspects of our solution. 
- Features
  - We tried to capture all the features we mentioned in last phase. However, we prioritized certain features over others. We also prioritized the overall design of our application so that it did not feel "cheap" or "raw".
